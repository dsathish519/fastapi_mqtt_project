setting up fastapi ,
connecting mongodb from fastapi
use onstart event to start mongo onstart and threading to start the mqtt_publisher and subscriber files
depedency injection 
setup a mqtt client to publisher data for humidity and temperature
setup a mqtt client to subscribe to the topics and stores the data in mongodb
create a snesor.py file that retrevie the stored data based on certain conditions
path /sensor/{topic}
{topic} - could be temperature or humidity
filter the data by checking in to the specified collection
- I used postman to test the api's 
- input test data: {
    "start_time": "2023-09-10T10:43:20Z",
    "end_time": "2023-09-10T10:56:01Z"
}
last-ten-readings - return the data from redis for last 10 instances 
- params : key : sensor_id - Value: sensor1/sensor2/sensor3
           key : data_type - Value: temperature/humidity

NOTE : run -  sudo systemctl start redis and sudo systemctl start mosquitto , in a seperate new terminal to start mosquitto broker and redis server.

Challenges faced while working on this project - one of the major challenge is to start mqtt_publish, mqtt_subscribe file parallelly, inital i try setting up
mqtt_publish and subscribe inside onstart but it was blocking the fastapi sever, then tried few other approaches but nothing worked out finially, i came across 
import threading which worked out splendidly in the end for me without blocking other processess running.
